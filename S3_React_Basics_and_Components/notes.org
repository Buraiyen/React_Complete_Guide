#+TITLE: Section 3: React Basics and Working With Components

* Module Introduction

We will learn how to use everything that makes up React
- React Core Syntax & JSX
- Work with components
- Work with data

* 1. What Are Components? And Why is React All About them?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- HTML/CSS/JS are about building user interfaces as well
- We use libraries like React _to simplify building user interfaces_
  + This is through the use of *components*

- All user interfaces in the end are made up of components

- in this picture, these components are the same; they are just reused twice
- *components* _are reusable building blocks in your user interface_
  - though you don't have to reuse components
- components are made up of HTML for text, CSS for styling, and possibly JS for logic
- React embraces the concept of components because of
  1. Resusablility - not repeating yourself
  2. Separation of concerns - keeping code base small and manageable. Don't do too many things in one and the same place
