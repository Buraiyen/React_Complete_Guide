#+TITLE: Section 9 - Working with Fragments, Portals, and "Refs"

* JSX Limitations and Workarounds

** One Root Element

- JSX doesn't allow more than one root element
- this makes sense because you cannot return more than one item in regular JavaScript

#+begin_src js
return (
    React.createElement('h2', {}, 'Hi there!');
    React.createElement('p', {}, 'This does not work :(');
)
#+end_src

- you can only have 1 createElement call
- one workaround is wrapping a div or any other non-empty element
- instead of elements, you can also use JavaScript array syntax. Each element inside of the array must be separated by commas
  - but a gotcha of this is that React would want a key
- a drawback of having <div> as a wrapper is that you can have "<div> soup"

#+begin_src html
<div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h1> hi </h1>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
#+end_src

- in larger apps, you can easily end up with tons of unnecessary divs

* Creating a Wrapper Component

- we will create a wrapper component

#+begin_src js
const Wrapper = (props) => {
  return props.children;
};

export default Wrapper;
#+end_src

- this is basically an empty component
