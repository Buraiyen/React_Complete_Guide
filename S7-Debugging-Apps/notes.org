#+TITLE: Section 7: Debugging React Apps

* Understanding React Error Messages

- the project is slightly altered from the previous section to have errors
- the project failed to compile with this error

#+begin_src
./src/App.js
SyntaxError: /home/buraiyen/Documents/React_Complete_Guide/S7-Debugging-Apps/react-complete-guide/src/App.js: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>? (43:6)

  41 |         <CourseInput onAddGoal={addGoalHandler} />
  42 |       </section>
> 43 |       <section id="goals">
     |       ^
  44 |         {content}
  45 |       </section>
  46 |
#+end_src

- react is wanting us to wrap all elements in one surrounding element

* Analyzing Code Flow and Warnings

- In the project, if we try to delete a goal, then it deletes the one below it
- let's go to the place where we have the deletion logic, which is on ~App.js~ in the deleteItemHandler function
- we then see this

#+begin_src js
 const addGoalHandler = (enteredText) => {
    setCourseGoals((prevGoals) => {
      const updatedGoals = [...prevGoals];
      updatedGoals.unshift({ text: enteredText, id: 'goal1' });
      return updatedGoals;
    });
  };
#+end_src

- we see that we are hard-coding the ID and making it the same for all goals
- we can also see the console in the dev tools

* Working With breakpoints

- let's say we never seen that warning in the console
- in dev tools, you can access your files in the `Sources` tab (Firefox is `Debugger`)
- add a breakpoint to the delete function
- use the tools to go to the next step
- you can hover over variables to see their value
- if you click on two goals and see the same ID, then that's how you see there's a problem

* React Dev tools

- when you download react dev tools, you should be able to see these options:

- the `Components` tab has all of the React components in the app
- you can see the props and states inside of components
- you can also edit the props and state from here
