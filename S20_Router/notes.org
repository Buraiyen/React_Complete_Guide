#+TITLE: Section 20 - React Router

* Defining and Using Routes

- to install the router, run the following code:

  ~npm i react-router-dom@5~

  This ensures that the version is v5

- let's import the router to ~App~

#+begin_src js
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
#+end_src

- now let's add some components. We will add ~Welcome.js~ and ~Products.js~
- then we will use the ~Route~ component to render the pages. This needs a special prop called ~path~, which takes in the value of the URL. Inside of the ~Route~ component would be the component that we will render

#+begin_src js
// App.js
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';

import Welcome from './components/Welcome';
import Products from './components/Products';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Route path='/welcome'>
        <Welcome />
      </Route>
      <Route path='/products'>
        <Products />
      </Route>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
#+end_src

- to actually make the routes work, we would need to go into ~index.js~ and add a special component called ~BrowserRouter~

#+begin_src js
// index.js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
#+end_src
